**seizu** (型) is a contract-based state transition library for TypeScript.

Define `{ pre, transition, post, invariant }` with `define()` to get both an executable function and PBT-verifiable metadata from a single declaration.

## Packages

- **seizu** — Core library (zero dependencies). `define()`, `scenario()`, Result utilities.
- **seizu-cli** — CLI tooling. Static analysis, documentation generation, PBT verification.
